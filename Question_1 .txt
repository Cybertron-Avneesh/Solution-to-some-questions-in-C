3. Numerology considers the special relationship between a number and one or more coinciding
events. It has been used throughout human history as a way to attach meaning to a name, object,
or event using mathematics. Numerology is considered a “pseudoscience” since it has no basis in
observable phenomena. Nevertheless, it makes for an interesting programming challenge!

S T U V W X Y Z
Your program should start by asking the user to type in their name and convert all the letters to
uppercase. In the preceding table, each letter of the alphabet has a corresponding number. Using
this table, add up the total of all the number values in the person’s name to arrive at a single
whole number. If a user enters spaces or extra punctuation, you can ignore these characters. For
example, for the name “Dennis”:
“D” = 4
“E” = 5
“N” = 5
“N” = 5
“I” = 9
“S” = 1
4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 1 = 29
Once you have the sum, the number must be reduced so that it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, or 22.
In numerology, numbers are reduced by adding together their individual digits. For example, 29
reduced is 2 + 9, or, 11. Using this technique, continue to reduce the total until it is a number
between 1 and 9, 11, or 22. Hint: You will need to convert the total to a string to iterate over it
and convert its digits back to integers before you add them.
Your final program should work like this.
Enter your name: Dennis
Your personality number is: 11
